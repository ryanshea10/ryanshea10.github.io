I spent this week deploying BlenderBot 3 and testing what type of improvements it could gain over BlenderBot 2. Overall the bot’s memory seemed to be an upgrade over BlenderBot 2 although the model still does have some similar issues with regards to contradiction and topic switching which means that our classifiers will still need to be implemented to improve responses. One big advantage to using BlenderBot 3 is that it does not have the same type of concurrent user issues that are present in BlenderBot 2. Therefore switching to this bot will allow us to scale our chat service so that many users can chat with the bot at once without needing to wait in a queue.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On week ten Meta somewhat unexpectedly released BlenderBot 3 which includes memory improvements compared to BlenderBot 2 and is also much larger.

Adding n-gram blocking was fairly straightforward since the BlenderBot already supports that as a decoding option. To detect topic switching I used SiameseBERT to create sentence embeddings for BlenderBot’s responses then recorded the cosine distance between the chat history versus an off-topic response and an on-topic response, respectively. This method seemed to do a pretty good job at detecting topic switches with a cosine distance of 0.3 serving as a solid threshold for determining whether or not a response is on topic or not.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent week nine adding n-gram blocking to BlenderBot as well as testing a classifier to detect BlenderBot’s topic switching.

Unfortunately the issue seemed to stem from an issue inherent in the library that we are using to set up the chat service for BlenderBot 2. Instead I created a work around which involves using a queue to handle chat requests. With this method the bot will only respond to one message at a timeand therefore the issues related to concurrent users won’t occur. This had the added benefit on keeping the services memory at a minimum as it will not be using as many resources in parallel. On the other hand, if there are many users chatting at once this method could be problematic since the bot’s response time will grow with more people in the queue. This presents a pretty big issue in terms of scalability and will likely need to be fixed at some point. I am planning to reach out to the team who wrote the library to try and resolve this issue while continuing to work on other bots using the workaround in the meantime.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[During week six I worked on trying to fix the issue with BlenderBot 2 involving multiple concurrent users.

The model-based chatbot that I used to create these hybrid bots was Meta’s BlenderBot. The initial implementation of these bots is fairly simple, after certain states in the template BlenderBot will take over for a few turns and chat with the user. Then the template bot will jump back in to steer the conversation back onto the topic for the textbook unit. There are still some issues with this implementation which mostly have to do with the bot’s memory. BlenderBot currently does not have access to the phrases uttered by the template bot and therefore does not have the complete context for the conversation. There are also some issues with it retaining memory from previous chats which also cause some issues.

The bots are capable of extracting different natural language features from user responses using a combination of regular expressions and existing APIs. The language features are then used to generate different responses, if no usable features are present then the bot falls back to a set of default acknowledments. I also added a feature that allows the bot to move between units depending on the user’s input. This was actually the most difficult thing I did during the week since I had to add new variables in such a way that they didn’t affect the front-end or back-end of the web app.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent the third week incorporating acknowledgments into the template bots I made in the previous week.
