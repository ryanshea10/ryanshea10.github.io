      <h1><a href="/week10/">Week 10</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>On week ten Meta somewhat unexpectedly released BlenderBot 3 which includes memory improvements compared to BlenderBot 2 and is also much larger. I spent this week deploying BlenderBot 3 and testing what type of improvements it could gain over BlenderBot 2. Overall the bot’s memory seemed to be an upgrade over BlenderBot 2 although the model still does have some similar issues with regards to contradiction and topic switching which means that our classifiers will still need to be implemented to improve responses. One big advantage to using BlenderBot 3 is that it does not have the same type of concurrent user issues that are present in BlenderBot 2. Therefore switching to this bot will allow us to scale our chat service so that many users can chat with the bot at once without needing to wait in a queue.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week9/">Week 9</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I spent week nine adding n-gram blocking to BlenderBot as well as testing a classifier to detect BlenderBot’s topic switching. Adding n-gram blocking was fairly straightforward since the BlenderBot already supports that as a decoding option. To detect topic switching I used SiameseBERT to create sentence embeddings for BlenderBot’s responses then recorded the cosine distance between the chat history versus an off-topic response and an on-topic response, respectively. This method seemed to do a pretty good job at detecting topic switches with a cosine distance of 0.3 serving as a solid threshold for determining whether or not a response is on topic or not.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week8/">Week 8</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>On week eight we did an internal user test so we could recieve feedback on the different chatbots as well as other aspects of the website. The biggest issues with the bots that were identified were the bot being repetitive, saying contradictory things, and giving off-topic responses. I spent this week brainstorming and speaking with my advisors about potential solutions we could implement to help fix these problems. To help resolve the repetition issues we decided to add n-gram blocking into BlenderBot’s decoder and for the other two issues we decided to explore creating classifiers to detect bad responses and have the bot avoid uttering those phrases.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week7/">Week 7</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>During week seven I spent my time designing a new type of hybrid chatbot that uses BlenderBot as it’s driver instead of the templates that I had developed previously. Instead of having the templates dictate the flow of the conversation these bots simply use the templates to introduce a topic and have BlenderBot handle a majority of the conversation. Some bots also strategically insert template phrases and given intervals to keep the conversation on topic.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week6/">Week 6</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>During week six I worked on trying to fix the issue with BlenderBot 2 involving multiple concurrent users. Unfortunately the issue seemed to stem from an issue inherent in the library that we are using to set up the chat service for BlenderBot 2. Instead I created a work around which involves using a queue to handle chat requests. With this method the bot will only respond to one message at a timeand therefore the issues related to concurrent users won’t occur. This had the added benefit on keeping the services memory at a minimum as it will not be using as many resources in parallel. On the other hand, if there are many users chatting at once this method could be problematic since the bot’s response time will grow with more people in the queue. This presents a pretty big issue in terms of scalability and will likely need to be fixed at some point. I am planning to reach out to the team who wrote the library to try and resolve this issue while continuing to work on other bots using the workaround in the meantime.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week5/">Week 5</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>On week five I modified BlenderBot’s memory so that it was able to include template phrases in its memory. This was done by simply sending the template phrase to BlenderBot with a text flag to indicate whether or not the bot should respond to the phrase or only write to its memory. I also began to modify BlenderBot so that it could serve chats to multiple users concurrently. This was the most difficult thing that I did all week as it seems that BlenderBot 2 has an issue with its long term memory module where if two BlenderBot 2 agents try to write to their long term memory the agents interfere with eachother and cause errors. My work next week with involve fixing this issue.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week4/">Week 4</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I spent week 4 creating hybrid chatbots which combine responses from the template bots as well as model-based chatbots. The model-based chatbot that I used to create these hybrid bots was Meta’s BlenderBot. The initial implementation of these bots is fairly simple, after certain states in the template BlenderBot will take over for a few turns and chat with the user. Then the template bot will jump back in to steer the conversation back onto the topic for the textbook unit. There are still some issues with this implementation which mostly have to do with the bot’s memory. BlenderBot currently does not have access to the phrases uttered by the template bot and therefore does not have the complete context for the conversation. There are also some issues with it retaining memory from previous chats which also cause some issues. My future work will involve fixing these issues and improving the incorporation of model-based bots.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week3/">Week 3</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I spent the third week incorporating acknowledgments into the template bots I made in the previous week. The bots are capable of extracting different natural language features from user responses using a combination of regular expressions and existing APIs. The language features are then used to generate different responses, if no usable features are present then the bot falls back to a set of default acknowledments. I also added a feature that allows the bot to move between units depending on the user’s input. This was actually the most difficult thing I did during the week since I had to add new variables in such a way that they didn’t affect the front-end or back-end of the web app.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week2/">Week 2</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In the second week of my project I created the templates that the chatbots were to be built on. These templates were based on example sentences from two different English textbooks used by Japanese colleges. Each unit had a seperate template so in total I created 17 different templates. The hardest part about this week was thinking of different sentence variations and conversation branches. Each template needs to have variability so that students can have their own experiences with the bots and talk to them multiple times without it getting too repetitive. It was sometimes difficult to create this variability while still staying on topic with the textbook units.</p>

      <h1><a href="/week1/">Week 1</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>During the first week of my work I mostly spent my time familiarizing myself with the codebase that I would be working with. A general framework for the chatbots had already been established which I needed to understand so that I could fully flesh out the chatbots and add new features. The biggest challenge for me was actually just getting the python debugger in VS Code to work in different virtual environments. By default the debugger kept switching to the base envirnment and therefore couldn’t import the correct packages. After I got that working I was easily able to step through the program and figure out how the codebase was operating.</p>
