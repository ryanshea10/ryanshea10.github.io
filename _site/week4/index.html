    <meta name="description" content="I spent week 4 creating hybrid chatbots which combine responses from the template bots as well as model-based chatbots. The model-based chatbot that I used to create these hybrid bots was Meta’s BlenderBot. The initial implementation of these bots is fairly simple, after certain states in the template BlenderBot will take over for a few turns and chat with the user. Then the template bot will jump back in to steer the conversation back onto the topic for the textbook unit. There are still some issues with this implementation which mostly have to do with the bot’s memory. BlenderBot currently does not have access to the phrases uttered by the template bot and therefore does not have the complete context for the conversation. There are also some issues with it retaining memory from previous chats which also cause some issues. My future work will involve fixing these issues and improving the incorporation of model-based bots.
