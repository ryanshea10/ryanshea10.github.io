<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Ryan Shea, I’m currently a student in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/">CS@CU MS Bridge Program</a> and am going to transfer into MS program over the summer. I’m planning on selecting the thesis track so I can focus my efforts on research and hopefully pursue a PhD after I complete the MS program in 2023. Before coming to Columbia, I studied Economics at Virgnia Tech where I did an internship at NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS). After recieving my BA in Economics, I worked as an Economist at ONMS for two years where I conducted research centered around evaluating the state of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecosystem-services">Ecosytem Services</a> in National Marine Sanctuaries. While working at ONMS I also conducted research with <a href="http://www.alihabibnia.com/">Dr. Ali Habibnia</a> on methods for detecting nonlinearity in various kinds of time series data.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-advisors">About My Advisors</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/chilton.html">Dr. Lydia Chilton</a></p>

<p>Lydia Chilton is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University. She is an early pioneer in crowdsourcing complex tasks on Mechanical Turk. Currently she leads the Computational Design Lab, whose goal is to build AI tools that enhance people’s productivity. Dr. Chilton received her PhD from the University of Washington in 2015. She received her Master’s in Engineering from MIT in 2009 and her SB In 2007, also from MIT. Prior to joining Columbia Engineering in 2017, she was a postdoctoral student at Stanford University.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/">Dr. Zhou Yu</a></p>

<p>Zhou Yu is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University. Before that she was an Assistant Professor at UC Davis. The focus of her research is to bring together areas such as multimodal sensing, NLP, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to design, implement and deploy end-to-end real-time interactive intelligent systems that are able to plan globally considering interaction history and current user actions to achieve better user experience and task performance. Dr. Yu received her PhD at the Language Technologies Institute under the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017. Prior to her PhD, she received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Linguistics under English Language Major from Zhejiang University in 2011. She was featured on Forbes 30 under 30 in Science in 2018 and her team also won the 2018 Amazon Alexa Socialbot Competition. Their work on Persuasive Dialog Systems also won ACL 2019 best paper nomination.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-project">About My Project</h2>

<p>My project is centered around creating a web application to help Japanese college students learn English. My role is to create different chatbots for the students to chat with and practice their English. There are three different classes of chatbots that I’m working on creating. The first are template-based chatbots which are based on different key phrases from English textbooks. These chatbots simply repeat these key phrases along with some basic acknowledgments that depend on the natural language features of student responses. For example, if the bot asks “Hi, what’s your name?” the bot can detect if the student responded with a name and respond with an acknowledgment accordingly. The second class is a purely model-based chatbot which is built on top of Meta’s BlenderBot, this chatbot is a transformer based model and students can use it to practice English on their own time since the topics and phrases given from this chatbot don’t tend to align with the class textbooks. The third class of chatbots are hybrid chatbots which combine model-based and template-based responses. These chatbots switch between template responses and model responses so that the bots can remain on topic with the textbook while also maintaining the flexibility and variation afforded by model-based chatbots. This work has the potential to be extended to other fields where chatbots are needed to accomplish certain objectives while also being sociable and flexible.</p>
