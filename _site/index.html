<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Ryan Shea, I’m currently a student in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/">CS@CU MS Bridge Program</a> and am going to transfer into MS program over the summer. I’m planning on selecting the thesis track so I can focus my efforts on research and hopefully pursue a PhD after I complete the MS program in 2023. Before coming to Columbia, I studied Economics at Virgnia Tech where I did an internship at NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS). After recieving my BA in Economics, I worked as an Economist at ONMS for two years where I conducted research centered around evaluating the state of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecosystem-services">Ecosytem Services</a> in National Marine Sanctuaries. While working at ONMS I also conducted research with <a href="http://www.alihabibnia.com/">Dr. Ali Habibnia</a> on methods for detecting nonlinearity in various kinds of time series data.</p>
