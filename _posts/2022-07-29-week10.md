title: Week 10

On week ten Meta somewhat unexpectedly released BlenderBot 3 which includes memory improvements compared to BlenderBot 2 and is also much larger. I spent this week deploying BlenderBot 3 and testing what type of improvements it could gain over BlenderBot 2. Overall the bot's memory seemed to be an upgrade over BlenderBot 2 although the model still does have some similar issues with regards to contradiction and topic switching which means that our classifiers will still need to be implemented to improve responses. One big advantage to using BlenderBot 3 is that it does not have the same type of concurrent user issues that are present in BlenderBot 2. Therefore switching to this bot will allow us to scale our chat service so that many users can chat with the bot at once without needing to wait in a queue.
