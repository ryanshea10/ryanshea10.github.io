<p>During the first week of my work I mostly spent my time familiarizing myself with the codebase that I would be working with. A general framework for the chatbots had already been established which I needed to understand so that I could fully flesh out the chatbots and add new features. The biggest challenge for me was actually just getting the python debugger in VS Code to work in different virtual environments. By default the debugger kept switching to the base envirnment and therefore couldnâ€™t import the correct packages. After I got that working I was easily able to step through the program and figure out how the codebase was operating.</p>
