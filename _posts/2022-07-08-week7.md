title: Week 7

During week seven I spent my time designing a new type of hybrid chatbot that uses BlenderBot as it's driver instead of the templates that I had developed previously. Instead of having the templates dictate the flow of the conversation these bots simply use the templates to introduce a topic and have BlenderBot handle a majority of the conversation. Some bots also strategically insert template phrases and given intervals to keep the conversation on topic.
