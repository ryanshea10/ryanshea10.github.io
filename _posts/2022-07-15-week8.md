title: Week 8
---

On week eight we did an internal user test so we could recieve feedback on the different chatbots as well as other aspects of the website. The biggest issues with the bots that were identified were the bot being repetitive, saying contradictory things, and giving off-topic responses. I spent this week brainstorming and speaking with my advisors about potential solutions we could implement to help fix these problems. To help resolve the repetition issues we decided to add n-gram blocking into BlenderBot's decoder and for the other two issues we decided to explore creating classifiers to detect bad responses and have the bot avoid uttering those phrases.
