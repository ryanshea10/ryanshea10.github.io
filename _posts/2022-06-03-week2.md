title: Week 2

In the second week of my project I created the templates that the chatbots were to be built on. These templates were based on example sentences from two different English textbooks used by Japanese colleges. Each unit had a seperate template so in total I created 17 different templates. The hardest part about this week was thinking of different sentence variations and conversation branches. Each template needs to have variability so that students can have their own experiences with the bots and talk to them multiple times without it getting too repetitive. It was sometimes difficult to create this variability while still staying on topic with the textbook units.
