title: Week 3

I spent the third week incorporating acknowledgments into the template bots I made in the previous week. The bots are capable of extracting different natural language features from user responses using a combination of regular expressions and existing APIs. The language features are then used to generate different responses, if no usable features are present then the bot falls back to a set of default acknowledments. I also added a feature that allows the bot to move between units depending on the user's input. This was actually the most difficult thing I did during the week since I had to add new variables in such a way that they didn't affect the front-end or back-end of the web app.
