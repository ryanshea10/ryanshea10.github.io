title: Week 5
---

On week five I modified BlenderBot's memory so that it was able to include template phrases in its memory. This was done by simply sending the template phrase to BlenderBot with a text flag to indicate whether or not the bot should respond to the phrase or only write to its memory. I also began to modify BlenderBot so that it could serve chats to multiple users concurrently. This was the most difficult thing that I did all week as it seems that BlenderBot 2 has an issue with its long term memory module where if two BlenderBot 2 agents try to write to their long term memory the agents interfere with eachother and cause errors. My work next week with involve fixing this issue.
