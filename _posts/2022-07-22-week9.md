title: Week 9
---

I spent week nine adding n-gram blocking to BlenderBot as well as testing a classifier to detect BlenderBot's topic switching. Adding n-gram blocking was fairly straightforward since the BlenderBot already supports that as a decoding option. To detect topic switching I used SiameseBERT to create sentence embeddings for BlenderBot's responses then recorded the cosine distance between the chat history versus an off-topic response and an on-topic response, respectively. This method seemed to do a pretty good job at detecting topic switches with a cosine distance of 0.3 serving as a solid threshold for determining whether or not a response is on topic or not.
