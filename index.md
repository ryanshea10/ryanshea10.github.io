## About Me

Hi! My name is Ryan Shea, I'm currently a student in the [CS@CU MS Bridge Program](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) and am going to transfer into MS program over the summer. I'm planning on selecting the thesis track so I can focus my efforts on research and hopefully pursue a PhD after I complete the MS program in 2023. Before coming to Columbia, I studied Economics at Virgnia Tech where I did an internship at NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS). After recieving my BA in Economics, I worked as an Economist at ONMS for two years where I conducted research centered around evaluating the state of [Ecosytem Services](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecosystem-services) in National Marine Sanctuaries. While working at ONMS I also conducted research with [Dr. Ali Habibnia](http://www.alihabibnia.com/) on methods for detecting nonlinearity in various kinds of time series data.
